Issue Summary
Duration:
The outage lasted for 1 hour and 45 minutes, starting at 08:30 AM and ending at 10:15 AM UTC on August 19, 2024.
Impact:
The outage affected the companyâ€™s primary web application, causing a 100% service disruption. Users were unable to access the application, resulting in failed login attempts and unresponsive pages. Approximately 85% of the user base, totaling around 340,000 users, experienced the issue during peak usage hours.
Root Cause:
The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer following a routine update. This misconfiguration prevented proper routing of traffic to the backend servers, leading to a complete service outage.
Timeline
08:30 AM UTC - Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating a significant drop in web traffic and increased error rates.
08:32 AM UTC - Engineering team received automated alerts and began initial investigation.
08:35 AM UTC - Suspected a database issue due to past incidents with similar symptoms.
08:45 AM UTC - Database team was brought in to investigate potential database connection problems.
09:00 AM UTC - Database team ruled out database issues after finding no anomalies.
09:05 AM UTC - Focus shifted to the application servers, suspecting a possible code deployment issue.
09:20 AM UTC - Application team discovered that the latest deployment had not introduced any errors.
09:30 AM UTC - Network team identified irregular traffic patterns and began investigating the load balancer.
09:40 AM UTC - Misconfiguration in the load balancer was identified.
09:50 AM UTC - Load balancer configuration was corrected, and traffic routing was restored.
10:00 AM UTC - Services began recovering, and user access was gradually restored.
10:15 AM UTC - Full service was restored, and all users regained access.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer, which was introduced during a routine update. The update inadvertently altered the traffic routing rules, preventing requests from reaching the backend servers. This misconfiguration led to a complete outage of the web application.
Resolution:
The issue was resolved by the network team after identifying the incorrect load balancer settings. The team restored the previous configuration, which immediately resumed proper traffic routing. Once the correct configuration was applied, the services gradually came back online, and normal operation was restored.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
Configuration Management: Implement stricter controls and automated validation checks for load balancer configuration changes to prevent misconfigurations.
Monitoring Enhancements: Improve monitoring to include load balancer health checks that can detect misconfigurations earlier.
Incident Response Training: Conduct a review session with all relevant teams to improve cross-team communication and reduce time spent on incorrect root cause assumptions.
Tasks:
Review and patch the load balancer to include automated configuration validation before applying any changes.
Enhance monitoring systems to include more granular alerts for network and load balancer issues.
Implement a rollback mechanism for critical network configurations to allow for quicker resolution of similar issues in the future.
Schedule an incident postmortem meeting with all involved teams to discuss lessons learned and prevent recurrence.
